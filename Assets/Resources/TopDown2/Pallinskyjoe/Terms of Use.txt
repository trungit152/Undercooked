Non-Commercial/Commercial: Free to use! Witch and Scarecrow follow base model of MV walking sprites, so legal license for MV is required for use in other 
RPG Maker engines. If used in a project, I’d like to be notified when the project is complete so I can check out the work. This isn’t a hard-and-fast 
requirement, just a pleasant request.

Edits: Edits allowed! However, please link back to originals/my resource thread and provide proper credits.

Repost of Edits: Yes! Again, please link back to the originals/my resource thread and provide proper credits.
Maker Required:
* For Witch and Scarecrow: MV license required for use RPG Maker engines outside of RMMV, as the bodies are in the style of MV sprites
* For Spider Mutant, Candy Corn & Ghost: free to use in any engine
